Problem #1 

Define a Employee.Prototype for the Employee constructor function shown below. The Employee.Prototype should have the property ssn set to "000-00-0000" and dept set to "empty". Also define a Employee.Prototype method that returns the follow string "firstName lastName : dept" .

Note: You can modify the below code in anyway to create the require Prototypes properties and/or method. 

function Employee(first, last, ssn, eid, dept) {
this.firstName = first;
this.lastName = last;
this.ssn = ssn;
this.eid = eid;
this.dept = dept;
}

var eJohnDoe = new Employee("John", "Doe", "123-34-1234", "001234", "acct");
var eSallyRally = new Employee("Sally", "Rally","123-34-1235", "001235", "hr");

 

Problem #2 

Create a an Object constructor function called BankAcct with the properties acctNum, acctOwner, checkBalance, saveBalance, acctType.  

Define a BankAcct.prototype method called checkTransfer() that accepts a amount as an argument. The method should check if the amount + checkBalance is greater than 0 before setting a new checkBalance amount. 

 

Problem #3

Write a JavaScript function to check if an object contains given property. Create a function checkGivenProperty() that accepts a object and a property name as arguments and return true or false.

Tip 1: Use hasOwnProperty.call() 

Tip 2: First create an object with properties , then use hasOwnProperty.call() to check for a given property.
