1. The script tag is an html tag which allows an html page to reference a script. Like many html tags the script tag also has attributes that can be set. Sometimes the attributes need to be set. In question 1 we have two attributes for the script tag. The first one, script type is defining what lanaguage the script is in. The second one, the src attribute is defining the location of the JavaScript file. This tag tells the browser what to anticipate and where to find it. The browser has a JavaScript interpreter which will allow it to parse and process the functionality that it was written for. The goal with the script tag is to communicate to the browser all kinds of programming logic. That is up to the needs of the problem and the creativity of the programmer.
