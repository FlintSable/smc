I would like to make a page with a simple navigation and a main jumbotron image. 

Below the image I would like to have a simple grid of a few items 6-9. 
Below that I would like to have footer with a short list of links one of which would include a form. 

Doctype tag - <!DOCTYPE html>
HTML tag - <HTML></HTML>
Head tag - <head></head>
Body tag - <body></body>
Division tag - <div></div> - for the separations of the header, navigation, body and footer
	I would also use the div tags for the grided items, maybe for those parts include h3, img, summary maybe more
Nav tag - <nav></nav> - for navigation menu at the top
img tag - <img></img> - for the main page image, with a src of the .png and the width and height defined.
ul tag - <ul></ul> - for the list of links in the footer, I would also include the <li></li> eleemnts for the individual items
a tag - <a href='url'></a> - I would use this for the various links on the page
h1, h2, h3 tags - I would use these for the titles and main sections of the grided items

Of the tags that we did not use I would like to incude some form actions that would send some json to the server.
