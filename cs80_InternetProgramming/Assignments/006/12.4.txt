Chrome Debugger tool Review: 

Goole Chrome Developer tools can brought up in various ways, F12 is one of those. The first tab is really helpful for testing html and css. The Network tab is a good way to see if you have your backend communicating to your front end. You can actually see the http requests and the codes for the request like 404 or whatever. Sources is good if you would like to see what another site is using for a specific part of code. This tab is also good if you want to step through your code because it allows you to put breakpoints in your code and pause at that point. My favorite part is the console tab at the end because it allows me to access the interactive REPL environment. This is where I can test something if I'm unsure how it works. That may about it for the Google Chrome Tools. I really like them and they make life so much easier. You can see that the dev tools interface can actually be inspected as well, which I think is pretty neat.
