This reminds me of when I got to watch the matrix for philosophy class. I am really glad we got to use this movie as an example for computer science class. I don't really watch movies these days. 
The mise en scene of the film is really cold and wide open. It really is beautify of a scene. 

The hut took a picture of the guy without even letting him know and it gave him a receipt. Oh my goodness the internal cave is so beautiful. Good great lord from computing heaven what do I have to do to be in this. The structure for the boxing bag is so cool. This guy is from the future of some kind but he still has a beard. I am freaked out about his place as well. I bet people get really mean when making this type of movie. That and they are really talented. They would all hold their own thoughts about how this needs to look. Being a cinematographer takes so much experience. 

I think this young man has a really really great opportunity to work with such a intelligent being. Woah he was given the ability to spy on the humanoid being. I wonder what that says about who he is and what he is. She does not meet people but it just got scary. 

She draws really really well and I agree that drawing is a form of intelligence. It seems as if he is more a robot than her. It is funny because she want to learn about him. She knows about him in different ways. Anything he says she knows so much more about but not in the way that he knows it. She really wants to get to know him. This is an amazing movie for computer graphics. The movie industry is pretty amazing.
