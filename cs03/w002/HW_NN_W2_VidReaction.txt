Here is a sample - use this format:

1. Ray Kurzweil - A University for the coming singularity
https://www.ted.com/talks/ray_kurzweil_announces_singularity_university

He starts off with the Information Technology and exponential growth. The comparison of his computer at MIT and our cell phones is very true. My cell phone in high school was really slow and the UI was not as responsive. Now I realize that my phone is a browser and has applications and works with an operating system. It really is a computer. I wonder what he is talking about today? It must be about 10 year. I wonder how much prediction he is satisfied with. I found that he is now interested in uploading consciousness. He would like the neo cortex to be extended to one that is stored in the cloud. Seeing him talk about the exponential growth of tech to the bio tech topic today is really interesting. Today he talks about the cloud, which are just servers that are available to users all over the world. Clouds are just computers that we can connect to. I think today the difference is the networking and the services associated with the servers. So with my brain today I think he would like us to get connected to remote servers with artificial intelligence. So in the near future we will do less cashier and labor work. The robots with do that. It only makes since that a company will also have an AI system that needs to managed as well. We are getting really interested in computing.  


2. Stephen Wolfram - Computing a theory of all knowledge
https://www.ted.com/talks/stephen_wolfram_computing_a_theory_of_everything

The topic is surreal and I am very atracted to it. Mathmatica, Wolfram Alpha and a new kind of science. Although this was made in 2010, he is working with a timless theme. The visual diagrhrams are amazing. We took a look at some celular automota visualizations. He somehow created a new type of science. I wish that I could use a tool like wolfram alpha to gather the data that like he does. The search results that he got back were amazing. It calculated where the international space station. I guess this is where the smart people get jobs. They become the exports which parse the knowledge. This search engine is so flexible and accurate. I need to find a way to keep this under my belt so that I can look up information. I am very happy with finding this tool. 


3. Kwabena Boahen - A computer that works like the brain
https://www.ted.com/talks/kwabena_boahen_on_a_computer_that_works_like_the_brain

He worked with the Basic programming language and came from a time when working with computers was a very thought full process. In Santa Monica and in California we have some electrical luxury. He makes me realize that we should try our best to solve some problems because of how privileged we are. Our brains are so efficient. It takes so much less energy to think about creative solutions. He says that the computer works like the brain and that makes sense because we created the computer and humans tend to make things that are similar to themselves. 


4. Gordon Browm - Wiring a web for global good

His way of speaking is very different than I am used to. He talks about how our ability to communicate instantaneously creates a globally connected culture. This changes our ethics and moves towards a global society which is different from a nation perspective. I like what he believes in but I think for someone like me, I see that it is important for individuals in a community to first be respectful to each other and be less of a nuisance to each other. I am so narrow minded in this matter because I have been living in a city for so long. I feel very immature in this topic but I can see how it relates to me. I think the interconnected nature of our technology is giving us so much insight about different parts of the world. At the end of the day though you still need an information parser because it will be way to much data for any one person. You need software to help with the sifting and for people with good intentions to work hard at coming up with solutions. I am still optimistic and have been for a long time. I would like to live a happy life and work on coding projects to help others. 


5. Chris Urmson - How a driverless car sees the road

I was never really excited about driverless cars but there is a certain amount of amazement with this topic. It relates to helping the whole world. I think this is an interesting solution to driving. I do see that driving is very dangerous and I know why. Cars are very strong and traffic is very bad. I don't really like driving next to people. I try to get over to Santa Monica around 6am because it is very smooth. I leave Santa Monica at about 10pm because I hate the traffic. Public transit is a big problem. In Los Angeles we have so many smart people, if we could resolve traffic problems we can all have more time to solve better problems. In some places you need roads but once you have roads this car technology can really help. I have seen an automatic parking car and it didn't do a very good job. I think it was about 25 minutes that this car was trying to get in but I'm sure this will get better. I know this is not that ready of a technology but I wish I had the education to be able to work on this kind of car. At Santa Monica College we only get into the surface of programming things like this but I found this https://www.udacity.com/course/self-driving-car-engineer-nanodegree--nd013 on Udacity. I wonder why sometimes some curriculums are so advanced in other places. I thought we were at silicon beach. I could program a car simulation with the same software as them if it were presented to me. I think Unity is very good for this kind of simulation. Game programming is very helpful to understand. 


6. Mitch Resnick - Let's tech kids to code
https://www.ted.com/talks/mitch_resnick_let_s_teach_kids_to_code

Mitch has a good point about young people being behind the screens. We interact but much less experiece with creating with new technologies. He says that it is much like we can read but not write. I think a good two year curiculum could really move the community of Santa Monica. I have been around to a few meetups and they are using technologies like React, Ruby, Node, Pyhton and Unity. I think scratch is good for childeren, maybe I could get a job teaching children how to make these little games. I wonder if Youtube uses scratch? I think last time I checked they were in python land. Stanford recently changed up their curiculum to javascript as the beginer comp sci class. I looked up what language scratch was made in. I found that it had moved from adobe flash to html5. Once I inspected the website with chrome debugger tools I found that it uses React JS. It is really crazy how often I am seeing this framwork. React.js uses DOM manipulation. Before people were really excited about Angular then angular 2 and backbone was in there somewhere. React.js is even used by MIT and facebook. 


7. Catherine Mohr - Surgery's past, present and robotic future

This one scares me. I forgot about this profession but I am glad that it exists. She starts off talking about the trephination. They cut holes in heads and there is evidence that people were healing. We have come really far in surgery technology. It is pretty amazing that you can take organs out of people and putting them into other lives. laparoscopic surgery. I am in awe with this one, it touches me in a way that is very different. Working with this technology would be a very heavy responsibility. It sounds weird but maybe there should be a little spider bot that could go inside. Maybe it would be more like a squid because that would be less sharp. I would like to work on a squid bot. 


8. Ken Jennings - Watson, Jepardy and me, the obsolete knot-it-all

Ken Jennings had and has a really interesting opportunity to write programs and be a one of the best jeopardy contestants. He experienced obsolescence in a very personal way. It is unbelievable what we will have to do to stay alive in the future and I could only imagine what Ken was feeling like when he was facing a beastly machine. We probably have to use the machines to benefit us or develop the machines that are useful. The future is scary and it makes me feel like we should be trained to compete. Seeing this footage is valuable. Watson seems like he is just a database of the internet but at the same time other two contestants are also so fast. The scope of human information is doubling every 18 months. Maybe this is because we are able to capture so much more information with sensors and robots. We can also document much better than in the past and there are so many more people to help with that task. It is pretty reasonable that there is so much information at this point. I need a skill to drive my ship into the near future waves. Currently there are too many distractions for people to be consumed by. Everyone needs to study more and put effort into progressing civilization. I will do my part by working on computer programs. I need some cyborg tools. Culture is really changing but it would be interesting to see what has not changed in the world despite the progress that has been talked about. 


9. Stefana Broadbent - How the internet enables intemacy

She makes a good argument about our increased intimacy. Even for me, I use my machines to talk to a good small group of people who are really close to me. Actually it would be hard to talk to these people sometime because of different schedules. She has a vary warm perspective of the current culture. I think my Mum would like this lady. One interesting perspective is the institution and how it is trying to block our attention away from what we want to do and into the space that we are currently in. I often message freely and I would love to work at a place that would allow for that as well. It seems really awful to put in so many hours of work and not be able to message my Mum or Girlfriend to tell them that I will be off in about 50 minuets. Those little things are just nice and they keep me human. 


10. Eli Pariser - Beware online 'filter bubbles'

This video was a nice finisher for the videos of the week. He brings up a very good argument about being in a bubble that we are creating just by clicking around. For one it is good to stay focused because I don't want to see everything but I would not mind useful information coming in. The query parameters are real, I can usually see them when I search for different subjects at websites. Some of those parameters hang out in the url, those are at least the ones that I can see. Sometimes I change the URL to get to different parts of a website. I use a couple of search engines and I can tell that the searches are different. I would like to learn more about this topic because I notice it so much. I would only like to learn about it to protect myself and help get good information to everyone.
