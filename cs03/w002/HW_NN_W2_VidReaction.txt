Here is a sample - use this format:

1. Ray Kurzweil - A University for the coming singularity
https://www.ted.com/talks/ray_kurzweil_announces_singularity_university

He starts off with the Information Technology and exponential growth. The comparison of his computer at MIT and our cell phones is very true. My cell phone in high school was really slow and the UI was not as responsive. Now I realize that my phone is a browser and has applications and works with an operating system. It really is a computer. I wonder what he is talking about today? It must be about 10 year. I wonder how much prediction he is satisfied with. I found that he is now interested in uploading consciousness. He would like the neo cortex to be extended to one that is stored in the cloud. Seeing him talk about the exponential growth of tech to the bio tech topic today is really interesting. Today he talks about the cloud, which are just servers that are available to users all over the world. Clouds are just computers that we can connect to. I think today the difference is the networking and the services associated with the servers. So with my brain today I think he would like us to get connected to remote servers with artificial intelligence. So in the near future we will do less cashier and labor work. The robots with do that. It only makes since that a company will also have an AI system that needs to managed as well. We are getting really interested in computing.  


2. Stephen Wolfram - Computing a theory of all knowledge
https://www.ted.com/talks/stephen_wolfram_computing_a_theory_of_everything

The topic is surreal and I am very atracted to it. Mathmatica, Wolfram Alpha and a new kind of science. Although this was made in 2010, he is working with a timless theme. The visual diagrhrams are amazing. We took a look at some celular automota visualizations. He somehow created a new type of science. I wish that I could use a tool like wolfram alpha to gather the data that like he does. The search results that he got back were amazing. It calculated where the international space station. I guess this is where the smart people get jobs. They become the exports which parse the knowledge. This search engine is so flexible and accurate. I need to find a way to keep this under my belt so that I can look up information. I am very happy with finding this tool. 


3. Dale Dougherty - We Are Makers
https://www.ted.com/talks/dale_dougherty_we_are_makers

In this video I learning about TED talks transcripts functionality. It was nice to follow along with the words. He talks about humans curiosity to make machines. Some of the machines that were made were really wild. He really sweeps the spirit of making. I want to make a game using React.js, I will do that before the end of the month. The transcript functionality is really awesome it does music and narration. It would be pretty awesome for this class if we made something that we could show to potential employers. That is really what I need from my computer science curriculum.
Another thing he talked about was the community of creators. I like that becauaes you need similar minded people to progress the enthusiam for the technology. I think that is why some of the microcontrollers and programming languages have gained so much popularity. The community is keeping the tech alive and updating it and using it to solve problems.
He is a really jolly guy, I like his style.  


4. David Hanson - Robots That Relate To You

This Doctor has so much character. His mustache is intense, his case is interesting. I think he is dissecting what it means to have emotional intelligence. I would wonder how these androids would be integrated into the real world. I am ready to walk side by side with them. I am wondering where the robots and androids are. Their existence in our life may just make us all be motivated to do something greater in our life. If though we get bored with creating a self conscious being then we may not be in a mature civilization. These robots and androids could be part of a simulation to help us achieve a simulation of reality. Thinking about this is very philosophical and for the most part I still believe that the world around me is reality. Sometimes I do think that I could hack though it. Hacking through reality could be fun but after that the world and my life would never be the same. I will keep on chucking along with simply being a computer science major and working towards becoming a software engineer. That for me is enough to master for now. 


5. Nick Bostrom - What Happends When Our Computers Get Smarter Thank We Are

Nick Bostrom has in interesting way of thinking about the future. I am curios to know how he got to his level of thinking. Why did he make his way into this territory? Off topic, I am noticing that this TED website was made with React.js. It is funny how I am seeing it pop up on many different web sites. React.js is a front end javascript library made by facebook. So he is saying that complexity takes time. How did he get his brain to think about this regularly? Did he work at a coffee shop and think all day or did he study all his life until he developed a voice? OK when he started talking about the speed of neurons, then I realize that he has a really in depth intuitively mathematical understanding of the physical world. In computers the speed of data flow is at the speed of light. He has a good point about the evolution of artificial intelligence. His perspective makes me think of time differently. I feel like there are moments when my brain thinks at the speed of light but if that were true I would not be simply taking this class. I would be inventing the best next solution for something great. When we create a problem solving machine we should just leave out the possibility of using humans as a solution. Human manipulation is not a solution because they should be working for us unless we wanted them to destroy humans. The moral values of the AI should have similar values to ours, that is a good idea. I like his opinion about that. The best person to work on AI would be someone like him, Him and his group. I think he has good intentions but I believe someone like him because I cannot daily think of a solution like him. He is really dedicated to his beliefs and is a very inspiring scholar. 


6. Amber Case - We are all cyborgs now

The title of this one is pretty interesting. I do feel like a cyborg because I am always on the computer. So she is saying that I have added this computer as a device to help me understand the world and communicate with the world. She picked up on a topic which is very relevant to our current culture. I have never thought of technology in this way. My phone as a teleportation device now that is interesting. Mental reflection is not happening as much as it used to but I think I still take the time to drift off without my phone and the internet. I really enjoy walking around buildings and just enjoying their height. It feels like she gets paid to talk to people. I had never known of a cyborg anthropologist. I wonder what kinds of fields are to come in the next 5 years. I wonder what I should try to jump into so that I can be an expert in something that will be amazing. 


7. Catherine Mohr - Surgery's past, present and robotic future

This one scares me. I forgot about this profession but I am glad that it exists. She starts off talking about the trephination. They cut holes in heads and there is evidence that people were healing. We have come really far in surgery technology. It is pretty amazing that you can take organs out of people and putting them into other lives. laparoscopic surgery. I am in awe with this one, it touches me in a way that is very different. Working with this technology would be a very heavy responsibility. It sounds weird but maybe there should be a little spider bot that could go inside. Maybe it would be more like a squid because that would be less sharp. I would like to work on a squid bot. 


8. Ken Jennings - Watson, Jepardy and me, the obsolete knot-it-all

Ken Jennings had and has a really interesting opportunity to write programs and be a one of the best jeopardy contestants. He experienced obsolescence in a very personal way. It is unbelievable what we will have to do to stay alive in the future and I could only imagine what Ken was feeling like when he was facing a beastly machine. We probably have to use the machines to benefit us or develop the machines that are useful. The future is scary and it makes me feel like we should be trained to compete. Seeing this footage is valuable. Watson seems like he is just a database of the internet but at the same time other two contestants are also so fast. The scope of human information is doubling every 18 months. Maybe this is because we are able to capture so much more information with sensors and robots. We can also document much better than in the past and there are so many more people to help with that task. It is pretty reasonable that there is so much information at this point. I need a skill to drive my ship into the near future waves. Currently there are too many distractions for people to be consumed by. Everyone needs to study more and put effort into progressing civilization. I will do my part by working on computer programs. I need some cyborg tools. Culture is really changing but it would be interesting to see what has not changed in the world despite the progress that has been talked about. 


9. Stefana Broadbent - How the internet enables intemacy

She makes a good argument about our increased intimacy. Even for me, I use my machines to talk to a good small group of people who are really close to me. Actually it would be hard to talk to these people sometime because of different schedules. She has a vary warm perspective of the current culture. I think my Mum would like this lady. One interesting perspective is the institution and how it is trying to block our attention away from what we want to do and into the space that we are currently in. I often message freely and I would love to work at a place that would allow for that as well. It seems really awful to put in so many hours of work and not be able to message my Mum or Girlfriend to tell them that I will be off in about 50 minuets. Those little things are just nice and they keep me human. 


10. Eli Pariser - Beware online 'filter bubbles'

This video was a nice finisher for the videos of the week. He brings up a very good argument about being in a bubble that we are creating just by clicking around. For one it is good to stay focused because I don't want to see everything but I would not mind useful information coming in. The query parameters are real, I can usually see them when I search for different subjects at websites. Some of those parameters hang out in the url, those are at least the ones that I can see. Sometimes I change the URL to get to different parts of a website. I use a couple of search engines and I can tell that the searches are different. I would like to learn more about this topic because I notice it so much. I would only like to learn about it to protect myself and help get good information to everyone.
