My Name is Nicholas Noochla-or, I am a computer science student interested in Web Development, python and javascript. Currently I am working at an architecture firm in IT. The place that I work at makes Buildings. For a while I wanted to be an Architect but at this point I have dedicated so much time to computers that they have become useful. I am here to learn more about computer science and do my best in classes and self study. It would be nice to get some computer people study groups and group job searches. Let me know if anyone wants me to create a Santa Monica College Slack channel where we can all It would be nice to work with Unix operating systems because I have read many machines in the world are running off that type of OS plus I am not half bad at bash. Santa Monica College is a really nice place for me after work, I am mostly taking this course online because I am not a traditional student. I worked for many years and feel like I want to just focus on programming skills. The degree really counts, it provides a sticktuativeness. Time is really the issue so I decided to take this class in the summer so that I could be ready for the other CS courses in the bigger semester. Many semesters have passed for me I just want to finish and get on to transfer although I have enjoyed Santa Monica for some time now. Lately I have been practicing JavaScript interview questions so that I could proceed in my career. I would love to work with JavaScript people and or python people. No matter really. The class structure seems pretty smooth, I am pretty excited to get whipping on the keyboard and finishing up the assignments.
