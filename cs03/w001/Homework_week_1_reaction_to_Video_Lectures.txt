1. Nick Bostrom - The Simulation Argument (Full)
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nnl6nY8YKHs&feature=youtu.be

Nick Bostrom talks about the simulation argument. There are three propositions he says are true. First civilization in our stage of development go extinct before maturity. Next we lose interest in creating a simulation of the mind, conscious being. He calls them ancestor simulations. Lastly we are living in a simulation, since we are in a simulation then there are many simulations. This made me think about perception differently. Especially as a student working on the computer so often. I wish that I could work with this guy but I am not sure what I would do for him or his team. I wonder if he is interested in creating simulations. I think there are many tools for doing such things but I would wonder if he thinks that those are not true representations of simulations. I always wondered if we could jet past a few hundred decades and attempt to speed up our evolution what would happen. He is interesting to listen to after a long day.

This lecture showed me how important technology is for children not just in first world countries but everywhere around the world. The reason for this importance is because technology is the key to connect kids who are secluded from the rest of the world to the rest of the world. These children may be computer geniuses and all they need is the opportunity to learn effectively which is what those computers were being used for. It was clear how important information and technology is to those children to inspire creative thought and innovation.

4. Brewster Kahle-A Free Digital Library

I personally do not like reading at all, however I did appreciate the fact that someone who does appreciate literature is going to such great lengths to preserve all the writing that has ever existed. I do like film and that was interesting to know how many movies are out there that are not even known about because they were not released in theaters. Iâ€™m excited to see if filmmakers will take advantage of these out of copyright films to possibly remake them so the world can see. Furthermore, the idea of storing television was also interesting, especially the concept of comparing news from different countries to obtain an understanding of different perspectives.

5. Brenda Laurel-Games for Girls

In this lecture it was cool to see how far video games have come in fifteen years. I'm very interested in games and I consider them an artform rather than just a pastime. I am hopeful to become a game developer in the future. The particular game she was talking about in the lecture was basically just clickable pictures with a relatively linear story. Nowadays we have actual playable models and vast open worlds with stunning graphics. It was also interesting to see how video games back then were strictly for boys and little girls were supposed to focus on typical girl things. Nowadays video games are much more gender neutral and female gamers are much more common.

6. Catherine Mohr-Surgery's Past, Present and Robotic Future

It was absolutely amazing to see how advanced surgery has become. I have never had surgery in my life and I honestly did not know exactly how it was done. This lecture enlightened me that surgery is no longer just a doctor cutting a patient open but it is now very advanced robots that do most of the work. It was also amazing to see how small yet precise the robotic instruments were compared to the footage of the doctor controlling this instruments by hand. It is interesting to see how technology has so many applications in this world nowadays and how computers are pretty much the backbone of most technology.

7. Chris Anderson-Technology's Long Tail

What I got out of this particular lecture was how all of the things he was talking about, and all of the predictions he was making were just about spot on. The lecture was from 2004 and he was speaking about netflix which basically put blockbuster out of business. Linux is almost as popular as apple and microsoft operating systems nowadays. Also I see a prius or another hybrid maybe 50 times a day. So, every technology he spoke about is still existent today and thriving just like he said it would 10 years later. It is interesting how fast technology advances this time and how basic the actual advancement of it is. Anderson laid it out into four steps and these steps are still very prevalent today.

8. Ray Kurzweil- A University for the Coming Singularity

This lecture was interesting but kind of frightening to me at the same time. It was amazing to know that technology will soon have the entire world connected. I really want to go into the field of Computer Programming but the way Kurzweil described how fast technology is growing and where it will be in the future made me question my own abilities. It is overwhelming to me to actually see how far technology has come in recent years from not only a material standpoint, for instance how much better cellphones have gotten, but from a numbers standpoint as well. Technology is growing exponentially and I hope I can keep up with it.

9. Alan Kay- A Powerful Idea About Ideas

This lecture made me wish I had teachers like the ones described when I was a kid. I just wonder how much better a student I could have been or would have been with the right teaching. It is true the children are the future and with the right opportunities the children of today have a real chance to make the world a better place. I mean there could be a child in the third world who has the right brain to develop a cure for cancer but without the opportunity for creative and innovative thinking that cure would never be discovered. This is why those laptops are so important and such a great idea.

10. Sergey Brin- Why Google Glass?

My reaction to this lecture was not as eye opening as many of the others. The one thing I did take away from this is how true it is that checking your cellphone is indeed like a nervous habit. I am totally guilty of it as well. For instance, I take my cellphone pretty much everywhere, and if I'm not doing anything important I almost always take out my phone to pass time on it. I'm interested to see if in the future how Google Glass will become the norm when it is introduced to the public. I will also be interested to see if it will catch on very quickly and perhaps even take over the cellphone industry.
