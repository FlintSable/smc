Here is a sample - use this format:

1. John Maeda - How art, technology and design inform creative leaders
https://www.ted.com/talks/john_maeda_how_art_technology_and_design_inform_creative_leaders/up-next

This is very interesting. He changed how I think about computers. It is funny how he liked performance art. I would have thought he liked graphics or something. Computers are much faster than people when it comes to computing. It makes me feel like humans will not be needed for work any more. The way he talks about form and content is really clear. If that is what a designer does I think he is really good. Interactive graphics. His graphic approach to showing connections between people within a company were really informative. I would be curios what it would be like to work with him. People seem to really like him. 

2. Zeynep Tufekci - Machine intelligence makes human morals more important
https://www.ted.com/talks/zeynep_tufekci_machine_intelligence_makes_human_morals_more_important/up-next

She is really funny and I really like that she is computer scientist at a young age. I feel like I have decided for computer science because of the future. I knew that talking to computers was going to be needed. Studying computer science has made me think differently, I feel like I am paying more attention to small details of process and logic. I am still a student so don't get me wrong. There are ethics now in computer software. The software is very complex today but if they showed people then it would be easier to understand but that is the problem. Some people do not want to expose the logic of their systems. Artificial intelligence is a real trend at this point. I wonder what kinds of machines I will get to teach in the future. I like that she says early job as a programmer. Systems could be filtering out possible solutions or interesting people. She brings up a good point. I wish I were a programmer at 18. 


3. Sebastian Wernicke - How to use data to make a hit TV show
https://www.ted.com/talks/sebastian_wernicke_how_to_use_data_to_make_a_hit_tv_show/up-next

Predictive analytics, wow! I have used the IMDB API before to capture the rating of movies. I did not realize they did this when they gave us free movies. I did not realize that new companies even had this capability. I really liked mass communications and this is really really about mass communications. I wonder what I can do to get better at computer science. Interesting he transitions into how people are being tracked to this same level. He makes a good point about the human brain and what it is good for. Pulling together the bits and pieces of information. This talk reminds me that we are being watched every moment that we are on the internet. I would really like to see what my online search profile looks like. It would be pretty interesting to see my tracks. 


4. Tufekci Zeynep - How the internet has made social change easy to organize hard to change
http://www.ted.com/talks/zeynep_tufekci_how_the_internet_has_made_social_change_easy_to_organize_hard_to_win

Twitter did change the world, that is pretty amazing. Wow a snapped photo got through the censorship. Now we might not be able to take out our phones in public events. We should install small cameras in our shirts and have them streaming all the time to a home network. That way we always have evidence. I think it these devices were stylish then culture would accept the action of watching out for ones self. We should get some designers to make small easy to purchase cool cameras that could attach to your phone. It would store the data on your phone. It would just be an extensible camera within a nice pin or something. Global awareness because of these applications is pretty amazing. I worked with the twitter API to gather my tweets and put them in the console. I never really thought it was such a world changing tool. I wish that I could have an automated car so that I could go to class tomorrow and still study for this class. It would be really nice to have the ability to work while commuting so that I could finish this class.


5. Frederic kaplan - How I built an information time machine
https://www.ted.com/talks/frederic_kaplan_how_i_built_an_information_time_machine/up-next

Time machine, Time machine, time machine! Time machine, Time machine, time machine! Simulations and time. He is deriving a from the information of past, present and future. That is similar to another Ted talk that I saw. I use the waybackmachine to see the progress of websites. I wonder if it were possible to gather photos that were taken in the world with mobile devices and stitch them together with algorithms and AI. It use the geolocation as help for the location of where the photo should go. Maybe the gyro scope could help with orientation of the photo. He is a time kook.


6. Luis Von Ahn - Massive-scale online collaboration
https://www.ted.com/talks/luis_von_ahn_massive_scale_online_collaboration/up-next

Massive scale online collaboration. Luis actually worked on the captcha technology. I didn't realize that captchas are so useful. Oh wow, he is dedicating peoples brains to get a job done. That is amazing! For moments of their time. Optical character recognition, I have heard about this. We are doing the work that robots could not do it. Captcha vs reCaptcha. Twitter, Facebook, ticket master. This one is pretty inspiring. It could create unique connections between two words. They are getting their work done by making us work and it authenticates us. I like this guy. 100,000 people. Just beautiful. He has a good attitude about the problem at hand. 


7. Guy Philippe - How cyberattacks threaten real-world peace
https://www.ted.com/talks/guy_philippe_goldstein_how_cyberattacks_threaten_real_world_peace/up-next

Oh he speaks another language. Woah there are different types of people in this world, who speak different languages. He knows about America and Brazil. I wish I knew better French. Google translate did not make too much sense when I filtered the audio through translate. Thats good, I guess. Cyber attack is very real. All I was trying to do was learn how to make games with computer programming and now I am here with this madness. Isn't better if people act out of interest and curiosity then in fear. There are different types of people. He really likes this type of work but me this is just stress. Is it ok if I just continue my life without caring too much about this madness. I mean I don't want to be the paranoid guy on the computer but I do want to be a technology guy who knows how to code really well. 


8. Michael Merzenich - Growing evidence of brain plasticity
https://www.ted.com/talks/michael_merzenich_on_the_elastic_brain/up-next

I like Michael already the video has just started. He kinda looks like Woody Allen. What if before the brain came out of the womb it could develop more. That would raise ethical issues but maybe it could help us make better decisions as adults. He talks about the remarkable advancement of our minds and brains over time. His perspective is optimistic and forward thinking. One advantage that Michael has in this perspective is that there is evidence that our brains continue to grow over time. I am aware that computers and the internet actually make our brains change. The use of our brains are very different than ten to twenty years ago. What is interesting is that our brains are very mechanical in some ways. For instance the fluids and connections of neurons. The human brain is very dependent on its senses for learning. 

9. Philip Rosedale - Life in Second Life
https://www.ted.com/talks/the_inspiration_of_second_life/up-next

Phillip is very different from the other speakers. His Ted profile says he is an entrepreneur. Then he goes to live in the second life. He looks like Brad Pitt if I am not wearing my glasses. The execution phase is very hard in this world when you have limitations like getting raw materials, transportation and space. I really enjoyed the game the SIMs. Second life scares me. I feel like if I get to that level then I am would be really lonely. There are enough real people in the world. I like the idea but it seems like good juice for crazy man in the truck recipe. A game is good once in a while, if not go work on virtual reality technology or go to work. If you love games make games, you can't play all day. People need to work. 

10. Johnny Lee - Free or cheap Wii remote hacks
https://www.ted.com/talks/johnny_lee_demos_wii_remote_hacks/up-next

I give this guy credit. He works and he uses his brain. I like his productivity. I like how he takes ordinary technology and uses it for something else. One product of games that I do like are the abundance of technology. What we may take for granted is that our ordinary machines can actually do so much for us. This talk reminds me that as humans we ourselves can do so much. These videos make me feel anxious to make more happen in the world. I wish we could solve the traffic problem.
